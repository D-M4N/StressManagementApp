                    Text="Our App is dedicated to find the most simple way to relieve stress Tips to manage stressful situations. It might surprise you to learn that biological stress is a fairly recent discovery. It wasn't until the late 1950s that endocrinologist Hans Selye first identified and documented stress. 
                        Symptoms of stress existed long before Selye, but his discoveries led to new research that has helped millions cope with stress. We've compiled a list of the top 10 ways to relieve stress.
                            Listen to music. If you're feeling overwhelmed by a stressful situation, try taking a break and listening to relaxing music. Playing calm music has a positive effect on the brain and body, can lower blood pressure, and reduce cortisol, a hormone linked to stress.
                                We recommend cello master Yo-Yo Ma playing Bach, but if classical really isn't your thing, try listening to ocean or nature sounds. It may sound cheesy, but they have similar relaxing effects to music.
                                    Talk it out with a friend. When you're feeling stressed, take a break to call a friend and talk about your problems. Good relationships with friends and loved ones are important to any healthy lifestyle.
                                        They're especially important when you're under a lot of stress. A reassuring voice, even for a minute, can put everything in perspective.
                                            Talk yourself through it. Sometimes calling a friend is not an option. If this is the case, talking calmly to yourself can be the next best thing. 
                                                Don't worry about seeming crazy — just tell yourself why you're stressed out, what you have to do to complete the task at hand, and most importantly, that everything will be okay.
                                                    Eat right. Stress levels and a proper diet are closely related. When we're overwhelmed, we often forget to eat well and resort to using sugary, fatty snack foods as a pick-me-up. 
                                                        Try to avoid sugary snacks and plan ahead. Fruits and vegetables are always good, and fish with high levels of omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to reduce the symptoms of stress. A tuna sandwich really is brain food.
                                                            Laugh it off. Laughter releases endorphins that improve mood and decrease levels of the stress-causing hormones cortisol and adrenaline. Laughing tricks your nervous system into making you happy.
                                                        Our suggestion: watch some classic Monty Python skits like The Ministry of Silly Walks. Those Brits are so hilarious, you'll soon be cracking up, rather than cracking up."
